        "This paper describes and evaluates privacy-friendly methods for extracting quasi-social networks from browser behavior on user-generated_B-KP content_I-KP sites , for the purpose of finding good audiences for brand advertising ( as opposed to click maximizing , for example ) .",
        "Targeting social-network neighbors resonates well with advertisers , and on-line browsing behavior data counterintuitively can allow the identification of good audiences anonymously .",
        "Besides being one of the first papers to our knowledge on data mining for on-line brand advertising , this paper makes several important contributions .",
        "We introduce a framework for evaluating brand audiences , in analogy to predictive-modeling holdout evaluation .",
        "We introduce methods for extracting quasi-social networks from data on visitations to social networking pages , without collecting any information on the identities of the browsers or the content of the social-network pages .",
        "We introduce measures of brand proximity in the network , and show that audiences with high brand proximity indeed show substantially higher brand affinity .",
        "Finally , we provide evidence that the quasi-social network embeds a true social network , which along with results from social theory offers one explanation for the increase in brand affinity of the selected audiences ."

        "Nevertheless , it is known to be a pessimistic estimator in comparison to holdout estimates .",
        "To obtain more reliable estimators we need some forgetting mechanism .",
        "Two viable alternatives are : sliding windows and fading factors .",
        "We observe that the prequential error converges to an holdout estimator when estimated over a sliding window or using fading factors .",
        "We present illustrative examples of the use of prequential error estimators , using fading factors , for the tasks of : i ) assessing performance of a learning algorithm ; ii ) comparing learning algorithms ; iii ) hypothesis testing using McNemar test ; and iv ) change detection using Page-Hinkley test .",
